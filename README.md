***This project is a weather application that collects data from a sensor (BMP280) using
Raspberry Pi Pico W circuitry. The Pico W uses wireless connectivity to send
the data into the cloud and then is forwarded to the database. The two data
points are then retrieved from the database and visualized in the mobile appli-
cation. Additionally, the temperature reading is used as a control for an LED.
A temperature that is too low will turn on the LED***
